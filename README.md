# GEMSDOE86 — evidence-gated fault-prediction research

> **Current decision (2026-10-23): DO NOT SUBMIT any existing TIFF.** The literal uniqueness protocol is blocked by a hash-pinned registry witness positive on every scored-footprint pixel. This review generated no candidate and spent no competition slot.

**Pages:** [project decision](docs/index.html) · [executive submission guide](docs/executive-summary.html) · [ranked untried hypotheses](docs/hypotheses.html) · [evidence](docs/evidence.html) · [official-source ledger](docs/sources.html) · [irregularities](docs/irregularities.html)

**Download audit:** [per-artifact status, sizes, hashes, and local validation](docs/download-status.html) · [machine-readable report](docs/evidence/download-validation.json). Run `make verify-downloads` to reopen the published TIFFs and verify their ZIP/receipt bytes; format PASS does not authorize submission. GitHub Pages now tests and validates every artifact before publishing.

## Read at the start of every session

1. Read this current status and [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md).
2. Read the [full archived owner request](#complete-starting-request-archive) below and [`research/OWNER_PROMPT.md`](research/OWNER_PROMPT.md); the archive is user input, not performance evidence.
3. Read the latest [three-pass review](research/REVIEW_20261023.md), [negative JSON run card](docs/evidence/review-20261023-run-card.json), and [protocol preflight certificate](docs/evidence/protocol-preflight.json).
4. Preserve the no-experiment/no-TIFF stop while the universal literal-overlap blocker stands. Do not spend a weekly slot or treat a projection as a score.

## Immediate decision and audit-only download

No file is authorized for the competition. The retained H86B-GFCO GeoTIFF is available **only for reproducibility/audit**:

- [Download existing H86B-GFCO GeoTIFF — DO NOT SUBMIT](docs/downloads/gems86-h86b-gfco-44090dots-20261022T233826Z-8fb20e6b-zeros.tif)
- [H86B-GFCO archived run card](docs/evidence/h86b-gfco-run-card.json) · [direct literal-protocol review card](docs/evidence/review-20261023-run-card.json)
- Raster SHA-256: `897ebf7b790efb9b5668934f5929ae766d81d9ec2a4bee3faa7ef2ebaedc1116`
- Local format validation: **PASS** (15/15 shared checks plus template-format check); this is not organizer acceptance or uniqueness clearance.
- This review: **0 new experiments, 0 candidate TIFFs, 0 slots used**.

The active project gate is not “format-valid” alone. The dense witness has SHA-256 `ab0a0a62eecf066a82713b09dd49f0f638a91fa3dd81f54cc34ae89afa3872be`, `5,167,373` positive pixels, and covers all `5,106,385` allowed pixels. Thus every nonempty candidate support in the allowed domain has a literal forward three-pixel overlap of `1.0`, above the fixed `0.70` stop threshold. No density, lattice, Jaccard, or “like-for-like” exemption is authorized.

The existing H86B final-dot TIFF was also remeasured against six available prior rasters. Its forward overlap is `0.8099569063` against the earlier GMC-linepost raster and `1.0` against the dense witness; either is independently a stop. Its corresponding full-footprint rank correlations (`0.0570048` and `0.1184195`) do not undo the overlap stop. The complete row-level measurements and honest scope limits are in the [review card](docs/evidence/review-20261023-run-card.json).

### H86B historical spatial holdouts — not leaderboard scores

These values are **HOLDOUT-DTI**, evaluator `gems57-pooled-hide-v2`, and each includes its withheld-positive count and 95% CI. They describe the retained H86B artifact; no holdout experiment was run in this review.

| Spatial view | Withheld positives | H86B HOLDOUT-DTI (95% CI) | Paired HOLDOUT-DTI delta vs d2.8 (95% CI) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Buffered whole components | 11,321 | 0.107759 [0.090790, 0.125365] | +0.015871 [−0.000708, +0.034298] |
| Segment hide-all | 22,641 | 0.139607 [0.128563, 0.151298] | +0.038537 [+0.026890, +0.052409] |
| Segment hide-detached | 22,619 | 0.152085 [0.137847, 0.166234] | +0.048620 [+0.034296, +0.062730] |

The primary whole-component paired interval crosses zero. The H33-B2 fold-fair control is a holdout baseline—not the historical H33 artifact: H86B’s paired HOLDOUT-DTI delta versus that control has 95% CI `[-0.005198, +0.030252]`, also crossing zero. None of these quantities is an ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED score.

## H33 `0.2778` and leaderboard claims

The project records the user/owner claim `0.2778` for H33-2-B2, plus other historical values including `0.3195` and `0.4413`. **None has an authenticated submission-page receipt in this checkout, and no current official leaderboard page was freshly retrieved in this review. They are unverified claims, not confirmed scores.** The official page is linked for manual review in [Sources](docs/sources.html).

The archived H33-B2 artifact audit identifies a `37,654`-dot version derived from a `0.2708` base by deleting points within a two-pixel mapped-catalogue collar. Its note explicitly says `UNSCORED` and the stored `predicted_leaderboard_dti` is `0.274673...`; that field is a projection/diagnostic, not an organizer receipt. A sibling-repository ZIP was also recorded as containing a zero-byte member, so the historical bundle should not be assumed usable. These facts explain how the number may have arisen in the owner ledger; they do not authenticate the `0.2778` claim.

## Ranked, genuinely distinct hypotheses (none tested here)

The feature audit confirms H86B already contains magnetic Hessian/ridge and upward-continuation attenuation features, gravity derivatives, basement step/gradient/ridge features, a magnetic–gravity contact offset, and LiDAR/DEM chain fields. Those primitives are **not** called untried. Four distinct next ideas and their non-fault mimics, validation requirements, data availability, and official-source links are detailed in [`research/NEXT_HYPOTHESES_20261023.md`](research/NEXT_HYPOTHESES_20261023.md) and [Hypotheses](docs/hypotheses.html). They remain research proposals—not DTI projections or scores—and cannot be run while the current stop is binding.

## Three-pass verification record

1. **Pass 1 — implementation:** added a literal fail-closed two-phase gate, removed the runner’s `skip_literal_preflight` bypass, and made the pre-placement phase stop before placement or TIFF writing when any literal threshold fires or the registry scan is incomplete. Caller-side audits no longer use a like-for-like subset to clear uniqueness. The shared evaluator/writer were not forked or changed.
2. **Pass 2 — evidence review:** recomputed the existing H86B final-dot comparisons from hash-pinned local bytes, checked the universal witness and candidate SHA, re-ran local format validation, and documented that the H86B surface raster itself was not retained (the surface overlap is therefore an exact witness-based bound, not a direct replay measurement).
3. **Pass 3 — acceptance review:** checked the prompt archive, verified score-label caveats and official-source link status, tested the negative run card, site links, compilation, and regression suite. No model or emission code was executed as an experiment; no TIFF was generated.

Full findings and limitations: [`research/REVIEW_20261023.md`](research/REVIEW_20261023.md). The current run card ends as JSON at [`docs/evidence/review-20261023-run-card.json`](docs/evidence/review-20261023-run-card.json).

## Limitations and next steps

- **Hard blocker:** a nonempty candidate cannot pass the current literal overlap rule because the witness covers the entire allowed domain. Do not evade this with blank output, density exclusions, or a comparable-only registry subset.
- **No authenticated competition evidence:** no submission-page receipt or fresh official leaderboard record is present. The restored feature/sample/fault rasters are hash-checked local mirrors; their organizer-origin authenticity is not independently established here.
- **Incomplete registry:** the local cross-lane subset is not an organizer-complete or fully refreshed fleet index. An incomplete scan can prove a duplicate when found, but cannot clear uniqueness.
- **Missing reusable inputs:** the required shared cached feature stack is not present in this checkout; the prior H86B feature builder is candidate-specific and is not being re-run. The H86B pre-placement surface raster was not retained.
- **Holdout-target mismatch:** hide-and-recover measures catalogue-fault recovery, while the competition target is unmapped faults. Spatial HOLDOUT-DTI is a screening measure, not a leaderboard projection.
- **Next work:** preserve the negative result; update the registry only through a pinned, auditable process; obtain organizer-authenticated data/score receipts if available; design an independently justified new-fault validation target; and do not start a new lane unless the protocol is satisfiable without an unauthorized exception. The three-experiment/two-hour budget and separate slot-selector rule remain in force.

Review the repo.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE HIGHEST URGENCY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED!

MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION.  DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION.  BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION.  IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED TIF SUBMISSION.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt.  Read the entire prompt.  A lot of sites mention inspection only and a human inspector, but the inspection needs to be done through the project and needs to be validated for submission without human intervention.

PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL — read first. This session is one of several running from this same prompt.

1. LANE. Your lane is the single method paragraph below. Stay inside it. If your raster's rank-correlation
2.  with any registry raster exceeds [0.90], or more than [70%] of your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before placement AND on the final dots.
3. REUSE, DON'T REBUILD. Use the template's cached feature stack, evaluate_[holdout.py](http://holdout.py) and submission_[writer.py](http://writer.py). Holdout = hide-and-recover: withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.
4. LABEL EVERY NUMBER as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt). A projection is never written as a score.
5. LEAKAGE CANARY. Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any result. AUC above [0.90] means leakage until proven otherwise.
6. RUN CARD. End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry; raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters; verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.
7. BUDGET. Stop after [3] experiments or [2] hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the submission page.

The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions.  These websites are researched, and tested and have generated TIF submissions.  But we need to generate high scoring submissions.

I think it makes sense that in order for a submission to be validated that it needs to pass certain high scoring validation gates before confirming whether a file is unique and can be submitted for scoring.

The following is the leaderboard for the competition:

We need to quickly look at the results and results from the GEMSDOE websites above.

Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.

We have a good understanding of how our hypothesis, methodology, calculations, analysis are done so we should be able to figure out a way to score higher on the leaderboard using previous results and scoring that we have across the sites listed above.  We need to come up with distinct and unique strategies to score higher in this competition leaderboard.  We need to start doing heavy and deep research into the part of the project that matters the most, which is the scientific discovery of geothermal vents.  We should store all of our information and knowledge that we can gather from official verified sources.  This will serve as a starting point for other projects as well.  We need to think outside the box but still be grounded in proper scientific research, we are ultimately aiming for a top prize that many others are competing for.  So it's important to be contrarian but be smart about it.  We need to find sources of data that others are over looking or areas of the project when it comes to geothermal vents.  We need to do deep research and critical thinking and come up with new hypothesis to test.

0.3195	is the highest score right now so we need to design a new strategy, research, testing, analyzing, and generating submission system than the current website.  It should be unique, take unique approaches to generating a submission that can score higher than 0.3195.

Put this prompt into the repo readme and read it everytime we work on the project as a starting point to make sure we are building what we are aiming for and have a strong base to continue building and improving on making something useful for everyday use.  It should solve the problem of having to manually check everything ourselves and having an up to date current feed.

Review the repo.

The following is taken from the Arena AI team and I think it makes a good point on building a successful project, so let's keep the Core Values and Own the Outcome as a focal point when building, developing, researching, suggesting upgrades, and implementing the work.

Our Core Values

Maximize P(Win)

“Maximize the Probability of Winning”: our decision making framework. In every decision, we weigh tradeoffs, assess risk, and choose the path that maximizes the probability that Arena succeeds. We set aside our emotions and make tough decisions in order to maximize P(Win). “Maximize P(Win)” frees us from constraints and clarifies that we must put Arena first.

Own the Outcome

We own results end to end — not just our individual slice of the work. When problems arise and we have the means to act, we do so without waiting for permission or assignment. We treat failure and success as signals and use them to improve. At Arena, we stay accountable to the final outcome.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.


Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.

We need to focus on being able to generate a submission into the competition.

The site should be able to generate a TIF file that is required for submission.  It should be as easy as download to click a File to submit into the competition.  This needs to be in the executive summary or the very beginning of the site.  it should be obvious when you visit the site.

I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form:

"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"

Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Here is the submission page when i click submit file

New submission

File to submitNo file chosen

You can submit a single-band GeoTIFF (.tif) file, or a .zip file containing a single GeoTIFF, with your predictions. It must match the submission format's CRS, shape, and geotransform. You may wish to review the competition rules first.

Note (optional)

A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.

Work on the next steps from the previous sessions first.

The goal of this project is to place top of the leaderboard in this competition.  The following is the competition:

[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/)

We need to create a project that can compete and place top of the leaderboard.  We need to understand the problem, collect all the data and organize it into a clean easily auditable table with official verified links for manual verification.

This is the guidelines we need to follow.[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/)

Get familiar with the problem through the overview and problem description,[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/967/). You might also want to reference additional resources available on the about page,[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/968/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/page/968/).

Download the data from the data,[https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/data/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/data/), tab.

Create and train your own model. This reference solution,[https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution](https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution) implements a simple approach.

Use your model to generate predictions that match the submission format.

Tell me what are you limitations and what you need access to during this project.  We will need to find free publicly available sources and data from official and verified sources if we are to use 3rd party or external data.

this pdf outlines how submissions must be entered into the competition.

[https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf](https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf)

You must be able to do your own research, deep research, scientific literature research and organize the knowledge so that we can critically think through the problem and generate a solution through scientific and free publicly available information.  this must be done autonomously and must be constantly reviewed and improved upon.  Provide suggestions and improvements and implement them.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.

Site creation

Create a github page for this repo that has clean ui, user friendly, simple and easy to use.  It should be organized and clean.

It should include all relevant information in an easy to read format with official verified links as sources for review.  Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

**The single remaining blocker to training is data placement**: run `bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh` on any unrestricted machine into `data/`, then `python scripts/prepare_data.py` — after that the full train→inference→validate pipeline is ready to run (GPU needed for training; metric/losses/validation all verified working here on CPU).

you need to complete the above task by yourself.  Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.

Verify no hallucinations.

The goal of this project is to get a full list that follow our requirements.  No hallucinations.  Verify line by line.

Run this task through multiple passes.

Pass 1: Implement the task completely and verify the result.

Pass 2: Review your work for bugs, missing requirements, incorrect assumptions, and edge cases. Fix everything you find.

Pass 3: Re-check the entire implementation against the original request. Improve accuracy, reliability, completeness, and code quality. Fix any remaining issues.

Do not stop after the first pass. Each pass must build on the previous one. Before finishing, verify that the final result fully satisfies the original request.  Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

Go ahead and create a pull request and then merge the pull request onto the main. Make suggestions for what work still needs to be done and any limitations that is in the way of a successful project.  It should be worked on in this next session or the next session.  Work line by line verify everything no hallucinations.

## Session history

Prior merged work and historical artifacts remain preserved for audit in `docs/downloads/` and `docs/evidence/`; their individual cards and `docs/evidence/download-inventory.json` are authoritative for each file. Historical promotion/score language is not current authorization. This branch's review makes no competition submission and merges only through the current Arena branch workflow.
